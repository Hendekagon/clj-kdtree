TODOs for clj-kdtree

* For 1.0
** TODO node metadata? (id, etc)
** INPROGRESS insert, remove
** DONE make helpers private
** DONE Store points as native arrays (verify: less memory, faster computation?)
** DONE Test different data structures for nodes. deftype? defrecord? hashmaps?
   Stick with vecs? Focus on better memory usage rather than speed.
